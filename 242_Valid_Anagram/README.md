# Valid Anagram

## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
s = "rat", t = "car"
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

---

## Approach
### Key Idea:
Two strings are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequencies.
